    """Abstract class, which can be inherited for implementing different gas price strategies.

    `GasPrice` class contains only one method, `get_gas_price`, which is responsible for
    returning the gas price (in Wei) for a specific point in time. It is possible to build
    custom gas price strategies by implementing this method so the gas price returned
    increases over time. The piece of code responsible for sending Ethereum transactions
    (please see :py:class:`pyflex.Transact`) will in this case overwrite the transaction
    with another one, using the same `nonce` but increasing gas price. If the value returned
    by `get_gas_price` does not go up, no new transaction gets submitted to the network.

    An example custom gas price strategy my be: start with 10 GWei. If transaction has not been
    confirmed within 10 minutes, try again with 15 GWei. If still no confirmation, increase
    to 30 GWei and then wait indefinitely for confirmation.

        `None` which will make the node use the default gas price, but once you returned
        a numeric value (gas price in Wei), you shouldn't switch back to `None` as such
